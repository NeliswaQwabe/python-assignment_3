File Reader and Modifier - Python Program
-----------------------------------------

Description:
This Python program allows you to read a text file, modify its contents (convert to uppercase), 
and save the modified version into a new file.

The new file will have the same name as the original, but with "modified_" added at the beginning.

Example:
If you input: notes.txt
The program will create: modified_notes.txt

Instructions:
1. Make sure you have a text file you want to modify in the same folder as this program.
2. Run the Python program.
3. When asked, enter the name of the file (e.g., notes.txt).
4. If the file exists and can be read, the program will convert all text to uppercase
   and save it into a new file.
5. If the file doesn’t exist or there’s an error, the program will show an error message.

Error Handling:
- If the file is not found, you will see:
  "Error: The file does not exist. Please check the filename and try again."

- If there is a problem reading or writing the file, you will see:
  "Error: There was a problem reading or writing the file."
